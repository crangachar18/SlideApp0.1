# Housekeeping Note

At periodic points during development, review the app and database against these goals:

1. Secure
2. Easy to retrieve and edit objects
3. Scalable to more and new object types
4. Publicly accessible
5. Pleasant to look at

Platform plan:

- Trial implementation first: macOS app in Python (`PySide6`)
- Planned transition later: C++ Qt implementation
- Long-term target: iPhone accessibility
